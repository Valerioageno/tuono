# Tuono examples

This folder includes all the official tuono starters.

To simply scaffold the base project run in your terminal:

```shell
$ tuono new [NAME]
```

You can install any example included in this folder by just using the `--template` flag:

```shell
$ tuono new [NAME] --template [TEMPLATE] 
```

`[TEMPLATE]` is the folder name.
