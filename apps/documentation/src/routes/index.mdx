# Tuono

Tuono is a full-stack web framework for building React applications using Rust as the
backend with a strong focus on usability and performance.

Tuono (Italian word for "thunder", pronounced /2 Oh No/). Why Tuono? Just a badass name.

If you have experience with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) you will feel home here.

## Features

- üü¶ Native Typescript
- üåê Next.js like Routing
- üç≠ CSS/SCSS modules
- üß¨ Server Side Rendering
- üî• Hot Module Reload

## Introduction

Tuono addresses the following two limits:

- Enable React server-side rendering projects without using JS runtimes (Node, Deno)
- Ease the web development using a typically hard language like Rust.

#### NodeJs/Deno/Bun are the only runtimes that allow a React app to be server-side rendered (SSR)? (no)

Tuono is the first full-stack React framework with the server side written in Rust (check the [ssr-rs](https://github.com/tuono-labs/ssr-rs) crate).
Because of this, Tuono is extremely fast, and the requests are handled by a multithreaded Rust server.
React is still React - it is just superpowered.

#### Rust is a hard language, then writing server side code is hard as well, right? (no again)

Tuono provides a collection of utilities to handle server-side code seamlessly with
the React code. Each server side route is managed in a separate file alongside the React route.
The routing is handled by Tuono based on the files defined within the `./src/routes` directory.

#### How is Tuono different from Next.js?

The Tuono API tries to stick as much as possible to the Next.js one (or at least takes a huge inspiration
from it). The major difference is the backend system. While Next.js relies entirely on Node/Deno/Bun,
Tuono runs the server without any intermediary runtime. This enables impressive performance improvements
(check the benchmarks [here](https://github.com/tuono-labs/tuono/tree/main/benches)).
