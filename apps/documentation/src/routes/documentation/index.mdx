# Tuono

Tuono is a full-stack framework for building React applications using Rust as the
backend.

Tuono (Italian word for "thunder", pronounced /2 Oh No/). Why Tuono? Just a badass name.

## Introduction

NodeJs/Deno/Bun are the only runtimes that allow a React app to be full-stack right? (no)

Tuono is a full-stack React framework with the server side written in Rust.
Because of this, Tuono is extremely fast and, the requests are handled by a multithreaded Rust server.
React is still React - it is just superpowered.

Rust is a hard language, then writing server side code is hard as well, right? (no again)

Tuono provides a collection of utilities to handle the server side code seamlessly with
the React code. Each server side route is managed in a separate file alongside the React route.
The routing is handled by Tuono based on the files defined within the `./src/routes` directory.
