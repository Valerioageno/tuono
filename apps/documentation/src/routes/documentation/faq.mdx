      I installed tuono via cargo but I get `tuono: command not found`
    </AccordionItemControl>
    <AccordionItemPanel>
      You have to add cargo binaries to your `PATH` environment variable

      In a unix-like environ it should be
      ```text
      /Users/you-username/.cargo/bin
      ```
