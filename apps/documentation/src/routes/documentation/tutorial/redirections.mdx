# Redirections

What if there is a PokÃ©mon among all of them that should be considered the GOAT? What
we are going to do right now is creating a new route `/pokemons/GOAT` that points to the best
PokÃ©mon of the first generation.

First, let's create a new route by just creating a new file `/pokemons/GOAT.rs` and pasting the following code:

```rs
// src/routes/pokemons/GOAT.rs
use tuono_lib::{reqwest::Client, Request, Response};

#[tuono_lib::handler]
async fn redirect_to_goat(_: Request, _: Client) -> Response {
    // Of course the GOAT is mewtwo - feel free to select your favourite ðŸ˜‰
    Response::Redirect("/pokemons/mewtwo".to_string())
}
```

Now let's create the button in the home page to actually point to it!

```diff
// src/routes/index.tsx

<ul style={{ flexWrap: 'wrap', display: 'flex', gap: 10 }}>
++      <PokemonLink pokemon={{ name: 'GOAT' }} id={0} />
        {data.results.map((pokemon, i) => {
          return <PokemonLink pokemon={pokemon} id={i + 1} key={i} />
        })}
</ul>
```

Now at [http://localhost:3000/](http:/localhost:3000/) You will find a new link at the beginning of the list.
Click on it and see the application automatically redirecting you to your favourite pokemon's route!
