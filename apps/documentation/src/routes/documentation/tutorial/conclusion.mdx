# Conclusion

Thatâ€™s it! You just created a multi thread full stack application with rust and react.

The project is still under heavy development and many features are not ready yet but
I hope you got the taste of what is like working with rust and react in the same stack.

As I mentioned in the introduction I'd love to hear what you thought about the framework and the tutorial - feel free to reach me
at [valerioageno@yahoo.it](mailto:valerioageno@yahoo.it) or in Twitter (X) DMs [@valerioageno](https://twitter.com/valerioageno).

Ciao
