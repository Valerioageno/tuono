# Tutorial

This tutorial is meant for giving you a sneak peek of the framework and is intended to evolve during the
development - be sure to have [installed](/documentation/installation) the [latest version](https://crates.io/crates/tuono).

This tutorial is not meant for people that don't know React - in that case I suggest you to first read the
[React doc](https://react.dev/); Typescript and Rust knowledge is not a requirement though!

If you prefer to just read the code rather than writing it you can download the finished tutorial project with:

```bash
$ tuono new tutorial --template tutorial
```

> I'd love to hear your thoughts about the framework and the tutorial - feel free to reach me at [valerioageno@yahoo.it](mailto:valerioageno@ahoo.it)
