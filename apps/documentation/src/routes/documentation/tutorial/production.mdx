# Production build

The source is now ready to be released. Both server and client have been managed in an unoptimized way
to ease the development experience. To build the project to the production state, just run:

```shell
$ tuono build
```

This command just created the final assets within the `out` directory. To run the production server,
run:

```shell
$ cargo run --release
```

Check again [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/) This environment now has all the
optimizations ready to unleash the power of a rust server that seamlessly renders a React application!ðŸš€

> Note: The `out` directory is not standalone. You can't rely just on it to run the production server.
