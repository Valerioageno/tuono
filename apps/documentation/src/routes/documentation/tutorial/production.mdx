# Production build

The source now is ready to be released. Both server and client have been managed in a unoptimized way
to easy the development experience. To build the project to the production state just run:

```shell
$ tuono build
```

This command just created the final assets within the `out` directory. To run then the prodiction server
run:

```shell
$ cargo run --release
```

Check again [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/) - This environment now has all the
optimizations ready to unleash the power of a rust server that seamessly renders a React application!ðŸš€

> Note: The `out` directory is not standalone. You can't rely just on it to run the production server.
