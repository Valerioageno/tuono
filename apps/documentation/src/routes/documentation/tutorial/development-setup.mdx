# Development setup

## Scaffold a new project

To set up a new fresh project you just need to run the following command:

```
$ tuono new tuono-tutorial
```

Get into the project folder and install the dependencies with:

```
$ npm install
```

Open it with your favorite code editor.

The project will have the following structure:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ public
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routes
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ styles
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

`public/`: put here all the files you want to be public

`src/routes/`: All the files in this folder are considered routes. All the routes are server side rendered out of the box.
To add server side capabilities, just create a Rust file with the same name as the route (i.e. `about.tsx` â†’ `about.rs`).

`src/styles/`: In this folder there is the `global.css` file that stores all the global styles. For the rest of the project, you can use
CSS modules.

## Start the dev environment

To start the development environment, you just need to run the following command within the project folder:

```
$ tuono dev
```

The first time might take a little bit because it will install all the Rustâ€™s dependencies. All the other execution will be pretty quick!

> ðŸ’¡ The tuono dev development script is currently under strong optimization improvements.
> In case you face any error delete the cache `.tuono` folder and run it again!

Then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000) on the browser.
