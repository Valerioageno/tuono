# Getting started

## The CLI

Tuono is the CLI that provides all the needed commands to handle the full-stack project.

> ☝️ Check the [installation](/documentation/installation) page if you haven't installed the
> `tuono` CLI yet.

To list all the available commands, run `tuono -h`.

To create a new project, run `tuono new [NAME]` (optionally you can pass the --template (or -t) flag - check the examples' folder).

Then to run the local development environment run inside the project folder `tuono dev`

Finally, when the project will be ready to be deployed just run `tuono build` to create the final React assets and to set the server project in the production mode.

Now to execute it, just run `cargo run --release`.
