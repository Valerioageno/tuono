# Installation

## Requirements

`Tuono` is a development environment built in rust and typescript that outputs a website written with both the
languages. Since that you need the following tools installed on your computer to work with it:

- `Rust` - The rust programming language toolchain (Go [here](https://rustup.rs/) for installing both `rust` and `cargo`)
- `Cargo` - The rust package manager
- `NodeJs` - The Javascript runtime (Go [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) for installing both `nodejs` and `npm`)
- `npm` or `yarn` or `pnpm` - A javascript package manager

> NodeJs is needed just for the development environment. The final output will run on a rust server.

## Installation

The tuono `CLI` is hosted on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/tuono); to download and install it just run on a terminal:

```bash
cargo install tuono
