# Application state

The main reason Tuono is fast is that it loads just the features that are needed for the project.

To define them, you need to fill the `ApplicationState` struct in the `./src/app.rs` file, and
they will be automatically available in all the handlers you will define across the application.

```rs
// src/app.rs

#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct ApplicationState {
    pub website_name: String,
	pub base_path: String
}

pub fn main() -> ApplicationState {
    let website_name = "tuono".to_string();
    let base_path = "http://localhost:3000".to_string();

    ApplicationState {
        website_name,
        base_path
    }
}
```

> For the sake of simplicity here we just enable a `String` but you can add Database connections or
> HTTP clients (take a look [here](/documentation/tutorial/api-fetching) for an example with an HTTP client).

Now the `ApplicationState` is available on all the handlers as following:

```rs
// src/routes/index.rs

#[tuono_lib::handler]
// The first argument always is the Request
// The ApplicationState arguments are optional. You can use just the ones you need
// to use in the handler (with no specific order).
async fn my_handler(req: Request, website_name: String) -> Response {
    ...
}
```
