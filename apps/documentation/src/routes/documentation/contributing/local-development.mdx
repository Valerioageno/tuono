# Local development

Thanks for your interest! In this page you find the instructions to setup the `tuono`!

## Quick setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your-name-here>/tuono
cd tuono
pnpm i
pnpm run check-all
```

## Setup

### Fork and clone repository

After [forking the repo on Github](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your-name-here>/tuono
cd tuono
```

### Rust tool chain

Install the Rust programming language tool chain (`rust` and `cargo`).
Follows instructions in the official [docs](https://rustup.rs/)

### NodeJS - runtime

Install `NodeJS`.
You can follow the instructions from the [Node official site](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)

> ðŸ’¡ This project has a `.nvmrc` file to specify the node version used in development.
>
> Consider to use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) so you can run
>
> ```sh
> nvm use
> ```
>
> to simply pickup the correct version!

### NodeJS - package manager

We use [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io) as `NodeJS` package manager.

You can see which version of yarn we use by checking the `packageManager` field in the root `package.json`.

### Pre-flight checks

To check that everting is working correctly run:

```sh
turbo run check-all
cargo build
```

## Tuono development

1. Start tuono frontend build using

   ```sh
   turbo run dev
   ```

1. In another shell run

   ```sh
   cargo build
   ```

1. You can now use the binary inside `/target/debug/tuono` in another folder on your local machine

   > Consider to add an alias to your shell setup file
   >
   > ```sh
   > alias t="/path-to-repo/target/debug/tuono"
   > ```

## Documentation development

1. Change the current working directory to the docs folder:

   ```sh
   cd apps/documentation
   ```

2. Run

   ```sh
   tuono dev
   ```

3. Open the localhost URL.

> On the documentation remember that `tuono` `npm` package is installed from the registry and
> it is not linked to the repository.
