# Contributing

## TL;DR

The project is massive - if you like it, do consider contributing!

## Getting started

The `tuono` project can mostly be split into the following subdomains:

- The CLI
- The Rust backend
- The React frontend
- The documentation website (which is written with tuono ðŸš€)

To check what the knowledge requirements are for each domain, check the
[requirements](#requirements) section below.

We are currently managing the tasks' prioritization in the [Road to V1](https://github.com/orgs/tuono-labs/projects/2) project.
You can pick any task that you see in the `ready` column that is not already assigned.

If you want to contribute on something that is in the `backlog` column, or it hasn't been scoped yet, please drop a message in the [#general](https://discord.com/invite/khQzPa654B) discord channel so we can all have visibility of it.

## Requirements

It's not strictly required to know both React (& typescript) and Rust (even though it
would be a great nice to have).

Without taking into account specific cases, we can mostly split the domain requirements by:

- The `CLI` needs Rust knowledge (even though a couple of scenarios might also need Typescript)
- The Backend needs just `Rust`
- The Frontend needs just `React` & `Typescript`
- The documentation website needs just `React` & `Typescript` (or even less, since most of the
  code is markdown).
