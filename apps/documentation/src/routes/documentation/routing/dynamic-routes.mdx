# Dynamic routes

> ðŸš§ Only available for SSR apps. This feature will be soon available also for static generated apps.

When you don't know the exact segment names ahead of time and
want to create routes from dynamic data, you can use
Dynamic Segments that are filled in at request time.

## Convention

A Dynamic Segment can be created by wrapping a
file or folder name in square brackets: `[segmentName]`. For example, `[id]` or `[slug]`.

## Example

For example, a blog could include the following route `src/routes/blog/[slug].tsx`
where [slug] is the Dynamic Segment for blog posts.

```tsx
import { useRouter } from 'tuono'

export default function Page() {
  const router = useRouter()
  return <p>Post: {router.pathname}</p>
}
```

## Catch all segments

Dynamic Segments can be extended to catch-all subsequent segments by adding
an ellipsis inside the brackets `[...segmentName]`.

For example, `src/routes/shop/[...slug].tsx` will match `/shop/clothes`,
but also `/shop/clothes/tops`, `/shop`, `/shop/clothes/tops/t-shirts`, and so on.
