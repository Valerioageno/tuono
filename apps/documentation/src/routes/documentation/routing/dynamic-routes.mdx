# Dynamic routes

> ðŸš§ Only available for SSR apps. This feature will be soon available also for static generated apps.

When the exact segment names are not known in advance and you need to generate routes from dynamic data,
you can use dynamic segments, which are populated at request time.

## Convention

A dynamic segment can be created by wrapping a
file or a folder name in square brackets: `[segmentName]`.

You are going to probably use something like:

- `[id]`
- `[slug]`

### Example

Assuming you're working on a blog with multiple posts,
you can use a dynamic segment to define the post page: `src/routes/blog/[slug].tsx`.

The `[slug]` is the dynamic segment which will be used to identify individual blog posts.

```tsx
import { useRouter } from 'tuono'

export default function Page() {
  const router = useRouter()
  return <p>Post: {router.pathname}</p>
}
```

## Catch all segments

Dynamic Segments can be extended to catch-all subsequent segments by adding
an ellipsis inside the brackets `[...segmentName]`.

Given the following `src/routes/shop/[...slug].tsx`,
the following paths will be matched:

- `/shop/clothes`
- `/shop/clothes/tops`
- `/shop`
- `/shop/clothes/tops/t-shirts`
- and so on.
