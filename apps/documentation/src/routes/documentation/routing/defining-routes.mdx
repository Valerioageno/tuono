# Defining routes

Tuono has a file-system based router built on the concept of routes.

When a file is added to the `src/routes` directory, it's automatically available as a route.

In Tuono, a page is a [React Component](https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component) exported from a `.tsx` file in the `src/routes` directory.
Each page is associated with a route based on its file name.

Every page is rendered server side by default.

Example:
If you create `src/routes/about.tsx` that exports a React component like:

CODE

The `About` component will be rendered when loading /about route.

## Index routes

The router will automatically route files named `index` to the root of the directory.

- `src/routes/index.tsx` → `/`
- `src/routes/blog/index.tsx`→ `/blog`

## Nested routes

You can also create a nested folder structure, and files will still be routed in the same way.

- `src/routes/blog/first-post.tsx` → `/blog/first-post`
- `src/routes/dashboard/settings/username.tsx` → `/dashboard/settings/username`

## Pages with Dynamic Routes

Tuono supports pages with dynamic routes segments. 
For example, if you create a file called `src/routes/posts/[id].tsx`,
then it will be accessible at `posts/1`, `posts/2`, etc.

## The Root route

Tuono allows you to have a layout component to wrap all the routes included within the same folder.
To define such component you will have to create a `__root.tsx` file (is allowed only a single `__root` file per folder).

This file won't generate any route.

The following example will wrap all the routes defined in the project.

```tsx
// src/routes/__root.tsx
export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return <main>{children}</main>
}
```

The following example wraps only the routes defined within the `src/routes/posts` folder.

```tsx
// src/routes/posts/__root.tsx
export default function PostRootLayout({ children }) {
  return <article>{children}</article>
}
```

With such examples a `/posts/examples-post` route will be wrapper by both layouts while a
generic `/about` route will just have the first `RootLayout` as wrapper.
