# Contributing

## TL;DR

The project is massive - if you like it, do consider contributing!

## Getting started

The `tuono` project can mostly be split into the following subdomains:

- The CLI
- The Rust backend
- The React frontend
- The documentation website (which is written with tuono ðŸš€)

To check what the knowledge requirements are for each domain, check the
[requirements](#requirements) section below.

Currently, I'm keeping a private dashboard to prioritize new features and bug fixes, but if you
want to propose something, please open a new issue on Github or reach out to me using
my email address [valerioageno@yahoo.it](mailto:valerioageno@yahoo.it). I'm also available
on Twitter (X) DMs `@valerioageno`, [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valerioageno)
and discord `@__v__v__`.

## Requirements

It's not strictly required to know both React (& typescript) and Rust (even though it
would be a great nice to have).

Without taking into account specific cases, we can mostly split the domain requirements by:

- The `CLI` needs Rust knowledge (even though a couple of scenarios might also need Typescript)
- The Backend needs just `Rust`
- The Frontend needs just `React` & `Typescript`
- The documentation website needs just `React` & `Typescript` (or even less, since most of the
  code is markdown).
