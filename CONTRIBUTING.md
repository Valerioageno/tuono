# How to Contribute to Tuono

## Contributions

Any feature contribution or suggestion is strongly appreciated.

We are currently managing the tasks' prioritization in the [Road to V1](https://github.com/orgs/tuono-labs/projects/2) project. You can pick any task that you see in the `ready` column that is not already assigned.

If you want to contribute on something that is in the `backlog` column, or it hasn't been scoped yet, please drop a message in the [#general](https://discord.com/invite/khQzPa654B) discord channel so we can all have visibility of it.

Consider [opening a new issue](https://github.com/tuono-labs/tuono/issues/new/choose) if you find a bug.

## Bugs

**Did you find a bug?**

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/tuono-labs/tuono/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/tuono-labs/tuono/issues/new/choose). Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

**Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number, if applicable.
- The pull requests must pass all the CI pipelines
